dartdoc:
  ignore:
    # This package only contains lint rules and no Dart libraries. Therefore,
    # `dart doc` shows a warning (Dartdoc could not find any public libraries to
    # document in...). The warning may also be changed to an error in the future
    # (see https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc/issues/2907). To avoid problems,
    # should `dart doc` ignore that there is no Dart library.
